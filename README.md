# ASV Airframe for Pixhawk Autopilot
This represents a catamaran X-class ASV (Autonomous Surface Vehicle) using a Pixhawk 4 autopilot controller. This configuration will be suitable for use in QGroundControl.


We're dealing with a boat that has:

1. Two thrusters, one on each catamaran hull
2. Each thruster can provide forward propulsion
3. Each thruster can rotate around its Z-axis (azimuth control) using a stepper motor
